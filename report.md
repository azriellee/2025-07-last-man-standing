# High Issues

## H-1: Sending native Eth is not protected from these functions.

Introduce checks for `msg.sender` in the function

# Low Issues

## L-1: Centralization Risk for trusted owners

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

	```

	```solidity
	    function withdrawPlatformFees() external onlyOwner nonReentrant {
	```

</details>



## L-2: Solidity pragma should be specific, not wide

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Game.sol [Line: 2](src/Game.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.20;
	```

</details>



## L-3: `public` functions not used internally could be marked `external`

Instead of marking a function as `public`, consider marking it as `external` if it is not used internally.

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>

	```solidity
	    function getRemainingTime() public view returns (uint256) {
	```

- Found in src/Game.sol [Line: 353](src/Game.sol#L353)

	```solidity
	    function getContractBalance() public view returns (uint256) {
	```

</details>



## L-4: Define and use `constant` variables instead of using literals

If the same constant literal value is used multiple times, create a constant state variable and reference it throughout the contract.

<details><summary>5 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Game.sol [Line: 134](src/Game.sol#L134)

	```solidity
	        require(_percentage <= 100, "Game: Percentage must be 0-100.");
	```

	```solidity
	        require(_feeIncreasePercentage <= 100, "Game: Fee increase percentage must be 0-100.");
	```

- Found in src/Game.sol [Line: 165](src/Game.sol#L165)

	```solidity
	        require(_platformFeePercentage <= 100, "Game: Platform fee percentage must be 0-100.");
	```

- Found in src/Game.sol [Line: 197](src/Game.sol#L197)

	```solidity
	        currentPlatformFee = (sentAmount * platformFeePercentage) / 100;
	```

- Found in src/Game.sol [Line: 216](src/Game.sol#L216)

	```solidity
	        claimFee = claimFee + (claimFee * feeIncreasePercentage) / 100;
	```

</details>



## L-5: Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

</details>



## L-6: The `nonReentrant` `modifier` should occur before all other modifiers

This is a best-practice to protect against reentrancy in other modifiers.

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Game.sol [Line: 187](src/Game.sol#L187)

	```solidity
	    function claimThrone() external payable gameNotEnded nonReentrant {

- Found in src/Game.sol [Line: 323](src/Game.sol#L323)

	```solidity
	    function withdrawPlatformFees() external onlyOwner nonReentrant {
	```

</details>



## L-7: PUSH0 is not supported by all chains

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.
